# CS 3220 - Introduction to Web Programming

# Introduction

Welcome to introduction to web programming. In this class, we will learn
how to build a web application with Java together from the front-end to 
back-end and putting everything together at the end.

In first half of class, we will start the class by learning front end (HTML, CSS
and JavaScript). Labs and homework in this first quarter of the class will be
focusing on building the user interface and its behavior.

In second half of the class, we will be building the back-end in Java to support 
up the data storage and processing.

In back-end session, we will start by learning Java Servlet and JSP. Why?
A lot of existing companies, if having Java back-end, may still have these legacy 
applications implemented in this manner. We could start by learning Servlet and JSP.
Then, we will learn how to refactor from legacy to modern approach such as 
implementing a RESTful service.

Moreover, we will also be learning micro-services architecture by having students'
servers communicating to the worker simulation server through RESTful service calls.

## Prerequisites

Please note that you are expected to know Java programming before the class. In
this class we will be using Java quite a lot on the back end. If you are not
experienced enough in Java programming. Please find time to catch up. A gentle
suggestion would be studying your old text book!
